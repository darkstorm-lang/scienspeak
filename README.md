# Pseudo Scienspeak

This is a pretty dodgy tool that given a latin name will come up with a way to plausibly pronounce it using english pronunciation. It's original use was for helping to learn latin names for fish.

It is probably wrong, but gives you something that is possible and since no one is really sure how latin was pronounced when it was a live language it may even be right, who knows.
